# Config.json
> ðŸ“Œ **IMPORTANT NOTICE**  
> As of Unturned version **3.25.8.0** the `Config.json` file has been replaced by the new `Config.txt` file. This guide is kept for historical purposes, but we recommend using the **[Config.txt](/servers/docs/unturned-server/config-txt)** file for configuring your Unturned server.


The `Config.json` is the main configuration file for your Unturned server. It contains all the settings that control how your server behaves. 

You can find this file in the same `Servers/Default` or `Servers/unturned` directory as the **[WorkshopDownloadConfig.json](../unturned-server/workshopdownloadconfig-json)** file. 

## Structure
The `Config.json` file is divided into several sections that control different aspects of the server. Here is a typical structure of the `Config.json` file:
```
Config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ Browser
â”œâ”€â”€ Server
â”œâ”€â”€ UnityEvents
â”œâ”€â”€ Easy
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Items
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Vehicles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Zombies
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Normal
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Items
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Vehicles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Zombies
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ Hard
    â”œâ”€â”€ Items
    â”œâ”€â”€ Vehicles
    â”œâ”€â”€ Zombies
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

It is important to know what difficulty is your server set to, as it will determine which settings are used. The `Easy`, `Normal`, and `Hard` sections contain the settings for each difficulty level.

By default the server is set to `Normal` unless you change it in the **[Commands.dat](../unturned-server/commands-dat)** file.

## Sections
We have written detailed guides for each section of the `Config.json` file.
- **[Browser](browser)** - Customizes how your server appears in the server browser list.
