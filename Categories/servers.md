# Unturned Servers Documentation
Welcome to the Unturned servers documentation! This section provides technical documentation for managing and hosting Unturned servers.

## Overview
This documentation covers:
- Basic server setup and configuration
- List of available server/Rocket commands and how to use them
- Rocket installation, configuration, permissions, plugins and more
- Full, detailed and complete documentation of Config.json file

## New to Server Hosting?
This documentation will help you get started.  
If you haven't got a server yet we recommend starting by reading our [Self Hosting](/servers/docs/unturned-server/self-hosting) and [Third-Party Hosting](/servers/docs/unturned-server/third-party-hosting) guides. They will help you decide which hosting option is best for you.

If you have a server then feel free to explore the rest of the documentation to learn more about possible configurations, Rocket plugins, and more.

## Plugin Information
This documentation does not cover our plugins. For detailed information about any specific plugin, please refer to its dedicated page.  
You will find a list of all available plugins on the [Plugins](/servers/plugins) page.
