# Unturned VehicleManager Events
List of events that be used in Rocket plugins from [VehicleManager](https://github.com/Unturned-Datamining/Unturned-Datamining/blob/linux-client-preview/Assembly-CSharp/SDG.Unturned/VehicleManager.cs) class.
## Important Notes
- Always subscribe to events in `Load()` method
- Always unsubscribe in `Unload()` to prevent memory leaks
- Event handlers must match the exact signature of the event
- Use `ref` parameters when required by the event signature
- `using Steamworks;` is required
- `using SDG.Unturned;` is required
- `using Rocket.Unturned.Player;` is required
- `using Rocket.Core.Plugins;` is required

## Quick Example
```csharp
public class ExamplePlugin : RocketPlugin<ExampleConfiguration>
{
    protected override void Load()
    {
        VehicleManager.onEnterVehicleRequested += HandlePlayerEnterVehicle;
    }

    protected override void Unload()
    {
        VehicleManager.onEnterVehicleRequested -= HandlePlayerEnterVehicle;
    }

    private void HandlePlayerEnterVehicle(Player player, InteractableVehicle vehicle, ref bool shouldAllow)
    {
        // Converting variable player from class Player to unturnedPlayer from clas UnturnedPlayer
        UnturnedPlayer unturnedPlayer = UnturnedPlayer.FromPlayer(player);

        Logger.Log($"{unturnedPlayer.DisplayName} has entered the vehicle!");
    }
}
```

## onEnterVehicleRequested

```csharp
private void HandlePlayerEnterVehicle(Player player, InteractableVehicle vehicle, ref bool shouldAllow)
{
    // Converting variable player from class Player to unturnedPlayer from clas UnturnedPlayer

    UnturnedChat.Say(unturnedPlayer, "You entered the vehicle!");
}
```

## onExitVehicleRequested

    UnturnedPlayer unturnedPlayer = UnturnedPlayer.FromPlayer(player);

    // Informs the player of the seat change in the car
    if (toSeatIndex == 0) // To driver seat
    {
        UnturnedChat.Say(unturnedPlayer, "You moved to the driver's seat");

    Player player = vehicle.passengers[0].player.player;
    UnturnedPlayer unturnedPlayer = UnturnedPlayer.FromPlayer(player);

    // Event starts before vehicle.isLocked changes value
    // Checks if the vehicle is locked
