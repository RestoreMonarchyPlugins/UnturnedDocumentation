# Introduction

Imagine you'd want to create a plugin but couldnâ€™t do it without changing Unturned's code, or maybe you wanted to fix someone else's plugin (I'd not recommend to fix someone's plugin), thereâ€™s a solution for that! You can edit anyone's code directly from your own plugin using [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony).

In this guide, I'll show you how to use Harmony and some of the best practices. We will try to stop animals from doing any damage.

# Getting Started

First, download [Lib.Harmony v2.2.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lib.Harmony/2.2.2) from NuGet Feed to your plugin project, please make sure to use version `2.2.2` of `Lib.Harmony`, as it's widely used by plugins.

## Steps

### 1. Initialize Harmony & Patches

Initialize harmony with unique name (ID) and save it to a variable `harmony = new Harmony("com.restoremonarchy.plugin")`, the unique name is `com.restoremonarchy.plugin`, keep in mind other plugins might make a similar ID and pass it to harmony just like you, and you both will have problems. 

My recommendations about ID naming style:
1. `com.brand_name.plugin_name` - (`com.restoremonarchy.plugin`)
2. `Name` - simply pass the Name of your plugin to Harmony (`harmony = new Harmony(Name)`)
3. Keep it as you wish.

initialize Harmony in your plugin:

```cs
class Plugin : RocketPlugin
{
    const string HarmonyId = "com.restoremonarchy.plugin";
    Harmony harmony;

    protected override void Load()
    {
        harmony = new Harmony(HarmonyId);
        harmony.PatchAll(); // This applies patches from your plugin.
    }
}
```

### 2. Unpatch Harmony

To avoid issues like double patches when your plugin unloads or crashes, unpatch Harmony in the plugin `Unload()` method. Always pass your Harmony ID to `UnpatchAll(..)` to ensure it only unpatches your patches.

```cs
protected override void Unload()
{
    if (harmony != null) // make sure to check if harmony is not null.
    {
        harmony.UnpatchAll(HarmonyId); // Unpatch only your patches.
    }
}
```

Alternative approach:
```cs
harmony.UnpatchAll(harmony.Id);
// You don't need to have a `const string HarmonyId = ..;` anymore.
```

### 3. Patch

#### Patch Structure

1. Have `[HarmonyPatch]` attribute on top of your patch class, this is needed to let Harmony find your patch.
2. Create a **static** method for patch `static void SomePatchName(..)`, if you don't make it `static` the patch won't be applied.
3. `[HarmonyPatch(typeof(AnimalManager), "target method name...")]` attribute on top of the `static void SomePatchName(..)` method.
4. Specify the Harmony patch type on top of your patch method, there's actually 3 of them, but we will use only 2 of them:
    - `[HarmonyPrefix]` - once `sendAnimalAttack` method is called your patch is going to be called before Unturned's code, also you can prevent the original code to be executed, and instead for example execute only your own code.
    - `[HarmonyPostfix]` - once `sendAnimalAttack` method is called your patch is going to be called after Unturned's code, in simple words at the of the method.
    - `[HarmonyTranspiler]` - it's way more complex type of patch, there you can add/replace original Unturned's code instructions with your own, for example skip `method1()` and put your own method after `method1()` at some offset. 

#### Original Code (from dnSpy or Unturned-Datamining)

That code I found using [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy) by decompiling the `Unturned_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll`, or you can also search for your target method or thing you want to patch on [Unturned-Datamining](https://github.com/Unturned-Datamining/Unturned-Datamining) GitHub repo.

```cs
public class AnimalManager
{
    // other code is removed...

    public static void sendAnimalAttack(Animal animal)
    {
        AnimalManager.SendAnimalAttack.InvokeAndLoopback(
            ENetReliability.Unreliable, 
            Provider.GatherRemoteClientConnections(), 
            animal.index);
    }
}
```

#### Prefix Patch Example

Create a folder (e.g., `Patches`) and add a class, like `Patch`. When you call `harmony.PatchAll()`, Harmony automatically finds all patches in your plugin.

Hereâ€™s an example of making animals stop attacking players. We'll patch the `sendAnimalAttack` method in `AnimalManager` class.

Use a `HarmonyPrefix`, so your patch is going to be called before the original method (`AnimalManager.sendAnimalAttack`):

```cs
[HarmonyPatch] // Put this attribute on top of your patch class, that's how Harmony will find that.
class Patch
{
    [HarmonyPatch(typeof(AnimalManager), nameof(AnimalManager.sendAnimalAttack))] // specify the target type and target method, also instead of `nameof(AnimalManager.sendAnimalAttack)` you can have "sendAnimalAttack", but if Unturned made a breaking change once you compiled your code you will get an error.
    [HarmonyPrefix] // the patch type.
    static bool PrefixAttack(Animal animal) // arguments from the `sendAnimalAttack` method.
    {
        // Return false to skip Unturned's code, true to allow it.
        return false;
    }
}
```

```cs
static bool PrefixAttack(Animal animal)
{
    if (animal.id == 1)
        return true; // allow damage only for animal with id `1`
    return false; // restrict any other animals to damage.
}
```

```cs
static void PrefixAttack(Animal animal)
{
    // You can also have that method to be `void` it's ok.
}
```

If you will have more patches in your class you might want to have a `[HarmonyPatch(typeof(AnimalManager))]`, so you don't need to specify the type of patching class every time.
```cs
[HarmonyPatch(typeof(AnimalManager))]
class Patch
{
    [HarmonyPatch(nameof(AnimalManager.sendAnimalAttack))]
    [HarmonyPrefix]
    static void PrefixAttack(Animal animal)
    {
    }
    [HarmonyPatch(nameof(AnimalManager.sendAnimalAttack))]
    [HarmonyPostfix]
    static void PostfixAttack(Animal animal)
    {
    }
}
```

To access the `AnimalManager` instance in your patch:

```cs
static bool PrefixAttack(AnimalManager __instance, Animal animal)
{
    // Use __instance for the AnimalManager instance, and yes it has to be named as `__instance` otherwise it won't work.
    return false;
}
```

> **ðŸ’¡ PRO TIP**  
> The best practice is to `try catch` all of your stuff inside of the patch method, so in case if Unturned don't have any try catch inside of the code that might crash the server, and lead to a real troubles, also that just might be useful to understand what's broken in your patch.
> ```cs
> static bool PrefixAttack(AnimalManager __instance, Animal animal)
>{
>    try
>    {
>       if (animal.id == 1)
>           Logger.LogWarning("Found that animal!")
>    }
>    catch (Exception ex)
>    {
>       Logger.LogException(ex, $"An error occured in {nameof(PrefixAttack)}")       
>    }
>    return false;
>}
> ```

#### Postfix Patch Example

To run your code after the original method:

```cs
[HarmonyPatch(typeof(AnimalManager), nameof(AnimalManager.sendAnimalAttack))]
[HarmonyPostfix] // due to postfix (HarmonyPostfix) method is going to be called after `sendAnimalAttack`.
static void PostfixAttack(Animal animal)
{
    // Your code here, runs after the original method.
    // Note: Postfix can't have `bool` return value, it has to be `void`.
}
```

#### Cleanup

You can handle exceptions that are thrown while patching. Use the exception to see what's wrong.

```cs
[HarmonyCleanup]
static Exception Cleanup(Exception ex, MethodBase original)
{
    if (ex != null)
    {
        // Create an event here and subscribe on it in your plugin, and fire that event with exception you got here,
        // and I'd recommend to:
        // 1. Log exception.
        // 2. `UnloadPlugin()`, as your patches are probably broken, either Unturned's made a breaking change or you did something wrong.
    }
    return null;
}
```

# Harmony Documentation

The [Harmony Docs](https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/intro.html) are your best friend. They explain most things youâ€™ll need. I also recommend searching for examples of Harmony code directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (use "harmony" as the search term) or see [OpenMod](https://github.com/openmod/openmod). This often gives better results than using Google or other search engines.

# Conclusion

Youâ€™ve learned the basics of Harmony, sure there's a lot of more things to learn. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, I hope you found something useful here. See you next time!
