description: Learn how to start your own Unturned server and build a community.
---

Starting your own Unturned server is a great experience. You can do it just to play with your friends by your own rules or open a public server and build a community.

Follow this documentation to learn all the necessary steps to start your own Unturned server.

### Is it worth it?
It's definitely worth it if you have never done it before. You will get to learn a lot.

Over 20k unique players play Unturned every day on multiplayer servers according to [Battlemetrics](https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/unturned/stats). At the same time, there are around 2,000 servers online. 

To be honest that's actually not a lot of players per server. However many of these servers are empty, inactive or not as good as they could be. If you make a good server and manage it well, you can eventually get a lot of players.

Don't be discouraged if you don't get many players at the beginning. It takes time to build a community and most people that fail just give up too early.

I have been running Unturned servers for over 9 years and I believe the key is persistence. My biggest mistake was that I renamed my servers too many times and tried too many different things. I should have just stuck to one name and one concept and kept improving it. That's my take on it.
