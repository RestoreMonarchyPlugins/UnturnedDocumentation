Starting your own Unturned server is a great experience. You can do it just to play with your friends by your own rules or open a public server and build a community.  

Follow this documentation to learn all the necessary steps to start your own Unturned server.

### Is it worth it?
It's definitely worth it if you have never done it before. You will get to learn a lot. You can also make some money if you decide to open a public server and monetize it.

Over 20k unique players play Unturned every day on multiplayer servers according to [Battlemetrics](https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/unturned/stats). At the same time, there are around 2,000 servers online. 

To be honest that's actually not a lot of players per server. However many of these servers are empty, inactive or not as good as they could be. If you make a good server and manage it well, you can eventually get a lot of players.

Don't be discouraged if you don't get many players at the beginning. It takes time to build a community and most people that fail just give up too early.

I have been running Unturned servers for over 9 years and I believe the key is persistence. My biggest mistake was that I renamed my servers too many times and tried too many different things. I should have just stuck to one name and one concept and kept improving it. That's my take on it.


<!-- ### Hardware Requirements
#### CPU
You don't need a very powerful CPU to run an Unturned server. They usually don't consume more than 50-100% of a single thread.  

I have used the following CPUs to run my Unturned servers: 
- Intel Xeon E3-1270v6 - 4c/8t - 3.8 GHz/4.2 GHz (6 servers)
- Intel Core i7-7700 - 4c/8t - 3.6 GHz/4.2 GHz (6 server)
- AMD Ryzen 5 3600 - 6c/12t - 3.6 GHz/4.2 GHz (8 servers)

#### RAM
Unturned RAM usage per map is as follows:
- PEI: 1.05 GB
- Washington: 1.08 GB
- Yukon: 1.24 GB
- Russia: 1.50 GB
- Germany: 1.81 GB

As you can see, the difference between maps is not that big. I recommend having at least 2 GB of RAM for a single server. -->
