## Non-Cheats Commands
This is a list of vanilla player commands that can be used in-game on the server as an admin by typing them in the chat.

> **ðŸ’¡ PRO TIP**  
> If you have Rocket or OpenMod installed on your server, instead of using `/` as a separator, you must use ` ` (space) as a separator.  
> That's why when you want to include space in the message or reason, you must use quotes.   
For example: `/say "Welcome to our server!" 255 0 0` instead of `/say Welcome to our server!/255/0/0`.

### Admin
The `admin` command is used to give a player admin blue hammer. Admin can use all commands and has access to all permissions.

### Unadmin
The `unadmin` command is used to remove admin blue hammer from a player.

**Syntax:** `/unadmin <player>`
- `<player>`: The name of the player to remove admin from.

**Example:** `/unadmin MCrow`

> **ðŸ’¡ PRO TIP**  
> Unfortunately there is no way to remove admin from someone who is offline. If you want you can delete all admins.  
Stop the server and delete the `Adminlist.dat` file which you will find in the same directory as **[Commands.dat](commands-dat)**

### Ban
The `ban` command is used to ban a player from the server for a specified time.  

**Syntax:** `/ban <player>/[reason]/[time]`
- `<player>`: The name or Steam ID of the player to ban.

### Kick

**Syntax:** `/kick <player>/[reason]`

### Time
The `time` command is used to change the time of the server.

### Teleport
The `teleport` command is a complex command that can be used in different ways to teleport yourself or other players.

**Syntax:** `/teleport [player]/[location]`
- `[player]`: The name of the player to teleport. If you want to teleport yourself, you can leave this field empty.
- `[location]`: The location to teleport to. It can be one of the following:

## Cheats Commands
In order to be able to use cheats commands, you need to have enabled cheats in the server **[Commands.dat](commands-dat)** file. You can do this by simply adding the `cheats` to the file.

If you are hosting multiplayer server I don't recommend enabling cheats, because then your server won't be listed in the server browser for players with default filters.  

If you want to use commands to spawn in items and vehicles, I recommend installing Rocket on your server and using the commands `/i` and `/v` instead.

### Give
The `give` command is used to spawn in items.

**Syntax:** `/give [player]/<item>/[amount]`
- `[player]`: The name of the player to give the item to. If not specified, the item is given to the player who executed the command.
- `<item>`: The id of the item to spawn.
- `[amount]`: The 

**Example:** `/give 15/2`, `/give 363`, `/give MCrow/254/5`

> **ðŸ’¡ PRO TIP**  
> When you are specifying the amount of items, you need to use the `/` character to separate the item id and the amount.

### Vehicle
The `vehicle` command is used to spawn in vehicles at your current position.

**Syntax:** `/vehicle <vehicle>`
- `<vehicle>`: The id of the vehicle to spawn.

**Example:** `/vehicle 93`

### Experience
The `experience` command is used to give experience to a player.

**Syntax:** `/experience [player]/<amount>`
- `[player]`: The name of the player to give the experience to. If not specified, the experience is given to the player who executed the command.
- `<amount>`: The amount of experience to give.

**Example:** `/experience 1000`, `/experience MCrow/500`

### Animal
The `animal` command is used to spawn in animals at your current position.
