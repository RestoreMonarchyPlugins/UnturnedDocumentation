In order to be able to use cheats commands, you need to have enabled cheats in the server Commands.dat file. You can do this by simply adding the `cheats` to the file.

If you are hosting multiplayer server I don't recommend enabling cheats, because then your server won't be listed in the server browser for players with default filters.  

If you want to use commands to spawn in items and vehicles, I recommend installing Rocket on your server and using the commands `/i` and `/v` instead.

### Give
The `give` command is used to spawn in items.

**Syntax:** `/give [player]/<item>/[amount]`
- `[player]`: The name of the player to give the item to. If not specified, the item is given to the player who executed the command.
- `<item>`: The id of the item to spawn.
- `[amount]`: The 

**Example:** `/give 15/2`, `/give 363`, `/give MCrow/254/5`

> **ðŸ’¡ PRO TIP**  
> When you are specifying the amount of items, you need to use the `/` character to separate the item id and the amount.

### Vehicle
The `vehicle` command is used to spawn in vehicles at your current position.

**Syntax:** `/vehicle <vehicle>`
- `<vehicle>`: The id of the vehicle to spawn.

**Example:** `/vehicle 93`

### Experience
The `experience` command is used to give experience to a player.

**Syntax:** `/experience [player]/<amount>`
- `[player]`: The name of the player to give the experience to. If not specified, the experience is given to the player who executed the command.
- `<amount>`: The amount of experience to give.

**Example:** `/experience 1000`, `/experience MCrow/500`

### Animal
The `animal` command is used to spawn in animals at your current position.
