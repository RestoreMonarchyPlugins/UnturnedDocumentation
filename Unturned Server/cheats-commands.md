In order to be able to use cheats commands, you need to have enabled cheats in the server Commands.dat file. You can do this by simply adding the `cheats` to the file.

If you are hosting multiplayer server I don't recommend enabling cheats, because then your server won't be listed in the server browser for players with default filters.  

If you want to use commands to spawn in items and vehicles, I recommend installing Rocket on your server and using the commands `/i` and `/v` instead.

### Give
The `give` command is used to spawn in items.

**Syntax:** `/give <item> [amount]`
- `<item>`: The id of the item to spawn.
- `[amount]`: The number of items to spawn. If not specified, the default amount is 1.

**Example:** `/give MCrow 363 5`

### Vehicle
The `vehicle` command is used to spawn in vehicles at your current position.

**Syntax:** `/vehicle <vehicle>`
- `<vehicle>`: The id of the vehicle to spawn.

**Example:** `/vehicle 93`

### Experience
The `experience` command is used to give experience to a player.

**Syntax:** `/experience <player> <amount>`

**Example:** `/experience MCrow 1000`

### Animal
The `animal` command is used to spawn in animals at your current position.

**Syntax:** `/animal <animal>`
- `<animal>`: The id of the animal to spawn.

**Example:** `/animal 3`
