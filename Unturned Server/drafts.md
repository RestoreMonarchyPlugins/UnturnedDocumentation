### Is it worth it?
If you want to host a server to play with friends, it's a great experience to be an admin on your own server. You should do it. You will get to know the game better and possibly decide to open a public server. 

Is making a public server worth it? Is anyone gonna play on it?

Over 20k unique players play Unturned every day on multiplayer servers according to [Battlemetrics](https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/unturned/stats). At the same time, there are around 2,000 servers online. 

To be honest that's actually not a lot of players per server. However many of these servers are empty, inactive or not as good as they could be. If you make a good server and manage it well, you can eventually get a lot of players.

Don't be discouraged if you don't get many players at the beginning. It takes time to build a community and most people that fail just give up too early.

I have been running Unturned servers for over 9 years and I believe the key is persistence. My biggest mistake was that I renamed my servers too many times and tried too many different things. I should have just stuck to one name and one concept and kept improving it. That's my take on it.
