This is a list of vanilla player commands that can be used in-game on the server as an admin by typing them in the chat.

### Admin
The `admin` command is used to give a player admin blue hammer. Admin can use all commands and has access to all permissions.

**Syntax:** `/admin <player>`
- `<player>`: The name of the player to give admin to.

> **ðŸ’¡ PRO TIP**

Stop the server and delete the `Adminlist.dat` file which you will find in the same directory as `Commands.dat`.
