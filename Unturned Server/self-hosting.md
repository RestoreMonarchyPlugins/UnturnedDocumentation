If you want to play with your friends, you can start a server on your own computer. This way you can play together for free. 

There are some downsides to this approach:
* Your friends can only play when you are online or your computer needs to be running all the time. 
* Your computer needs to be powerful enough to run the server and the game at the same time.
* You need to have a good internet connection.
* When your computer crashes or loses power, the server will go down and you and your friends might lose progress.

We don't recommend this approach for public servers. If you want to run a public server, you should consider renting a server from a hosting company.
