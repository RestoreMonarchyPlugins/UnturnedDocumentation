Third-party means that you are not hosting the server on your own computer or a dedicated machine. Instead, you are renting a server from a hosting company.  

Game server hosting companies provide you with a server that is already set up and ready to go. They keep the server running 24/7 and usually offer web-based control panels to manage your server.

**How much does it cost?** It depends on the hosting company and the server's size. You can find servers for as low as $5 per month, but the price can range up to $20 or more, depending on the limits and features.
